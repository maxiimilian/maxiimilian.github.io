Generally, I am fascinated by the idea of solving complex physical modeling problems with data-driven techniques. 
Currently, I am pursuing my PhD research at the [Department of Geoscience and Remote Sensing](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/geoscience-remote-sensing) at TU Delft under the guidance of [Sukanta Basu](https://sites.google.com/view/sukantabasu/home) and [Rudolf Saathof](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.saathof/).
My research goal is to estimate turbulent fluctuations of the refractive index in the atmosphere -- so-called optical turbulence -- with machine learning. 
These fluctuations cause problems in numerous fields, such as astronomy or free-space optical (laser) communication. 
To overcome these issues, reliable and accurate optical turbulence models are needed.
