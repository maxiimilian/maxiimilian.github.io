      <title>KelpNet: Probabilistic Multi-Task Learning for Satellite-Based Kelp Forest Monitoring</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kelp forests are critical for marine ecosystems.
They harbor a diverse range of species and maintain ecological balance, which necessitates the accurate monitoring of their evolution.
We propose a multi-task ensemble deep learning framework to predict probabilistic maps of kelp forests from Landsat 7 satellite imagery.
We train parallel image classification and segmentation models to achieve robust kelp predictions.
Both model types are created as ensembles of 25 members producing probabilistic outputs.
A comparison of the classification and segmentation outputs allows for human sanity checking of the model predictions.
Our approach yields a high accuracy with a mean dice score of 0.7047 on test data and performed well in the DrivenData &amp;ldquo;KelpWanted&amp;rdquo; machine learning competition (#38/671, 3.88% below winning solution).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
